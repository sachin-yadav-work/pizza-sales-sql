SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Overview

This project provides an analysis of pizza sales using SQL. The analysis is divided into three levels of difficulty: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each section tackles a different aspect of pizza sales data, from calculating total orders and revenue to more complex insights like cumulative revenue and percentage contributions.

Project Structure

The project is organized into the following categories:

1. Basic

These queries cover essential business metrics such as the total number of orders, revenue, and identifying key pizza attributes.
	•	Retrieve the total number of orders placed
	•	Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales
	•	Identify the highest-priced pizza
	•	Identify the most common pizza size ordered
	•	List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities

2. Intermediate

The intermediate section includes queries that provide more detailed insights by joining tables and grouping data.
	•	Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered
	•	Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day
	•	Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas
	•	Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day
	•	Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue

3. Advanced

The advanced queries focus on advanced analysis techniques such as calculating percentage contributions and cumulative values.
	•	Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
	•	Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time
	•	Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category

Prerequisites
	•	SQL-based Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
	•	Knowledge of basic SQL queries, joins, groupings, aggregate functions and window functions

Usage

This project allows users to run SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from a pizza sales dataset. You can either use it as a template to practice SQL or as a reference for analyzing similar data.
